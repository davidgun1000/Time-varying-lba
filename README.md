### READ ME FIRST ###

This OSF page contains Matlab code to implement the time-varying cognitive models developed in:

Gunawan et al. Time-evolving psychological processes over repeated decisions.

There are three directories corresponding to the three time-varying models developed in the manuscript: AR, Trend, and Markov switching. The code in each directory applies the directory-named model to the speeded decision making data from Forstmann et al. (2008).

We provide a README file in each directory with some guidance for using the directory-named model. These README files provide brief information about the scripts contained in the directory. We recommend consulting the README file in each directory prior to using the scripts.
